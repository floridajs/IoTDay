#Mac

There is no need for a precompiled node_module for certain situations on the mac.
At least I haven't found an issue YET. 

But what I DID find is that my brand new Macbook Pro COULDN'T see the arduino devices. 
That's not a HUGE problem because the part that needs to "PROGRAM THE FIRMWARE" can be done on another computer and your node application can run well and fine on your mac regardless.

But for those that didn't join or are seeing problems you can try the drivers that worked for me.

They're from SiLabs over at: https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers

Drivers for the USB to Serial (TTL) connection that didn't seem to work on MY machine can be found here:
